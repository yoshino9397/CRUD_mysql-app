            Some peple say pictures taken by him are beautiful and ephemeral,Nostalgic so like Breaking Dawn.He once replied that if his photographs felt kind of warm, he knew and experienced the warmth and freshness of New York, and the darkness that existed at the same time.<p>He is good at using photographs to capture things that people in this city have never seen or felt. The city is a crucible of various human beings, but his photographs make any human being feel, shake, and appeal.Please take a look at the works that show his sincere and straightforward kindness. A toast to our beloved The dawn who loved him in a short life and Eiji ! </p></div>

            “A young girl named Ib visits an art gallery with her parents.
            While observing the many exhibits, she suddenly realizes she is alone. And in her search for others, she finds things awry in the gallery...”</p>

            <p>Ib treats Garry as he does to her. She likes him very much and feels safe near him, and Garry feels the same way, sometimes even needing Ib for his own protection and sanity. Ib often asks Garry questions, some being what certain words she can't read are, others about Garry. Garry is very important to Ib, which is proven by bond point system. If the bond reaches eight points, Ib will be able to give him her precious handkerchief when he cuts his hand. Also, if Garry is driven insane in the Doll Room, she will hug him if she's able to restore his sanity. Otherwise, she will hug him when he saves her from Mary's attempt to stab Ib in the Brown Area.</p>
            <p>
            Since the player chooses most of Ib's choices with Garry, not much can be told about their actual relationship. However, in one of the Ib All Alone endings she trusts him enough to return to the Fabricated World with the fake Garry, and in the Welcome to the World of Guertena ending, if Ib is unable to restore Garry's sanity, then she seems to give into despair and gives up, and in the Promise of Reunion ending, Ib acts pleasantly to Garry, caring and reciprocating his feelings for her.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid.

            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p></div>

        <p>A new dinosaur museum will open in the suburbs soon.Speaking of dinosaurs, this is it,Industrialist John Hammond has created a theme park of cloned dinosaurs, Jurassic Park, on Isla Nublar, an island off the Costa Rican coast.</p>
        
        <p>After a dinosaur handler is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify its safety. Gennaro invites mathematician and chaos-theorist Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live Brachiosaurus.At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the genome of the dinosaurs, and to prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby Velociraptor and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park; Malcolm warns about the implications of genetic engineering and scoffs at the park's conceptualization, saying that it will inevitably break down.</p>
        <p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick Triceratops.</p></div>

        Finally!<br>Renewed Louvre Museum website!! </a></span><p><span class="headline hl4">by Kaori Era</span></p></div><p>Isn't the Louvre Museum, which has a long history, a place that everyone longs for?It has also appeared as a set of many movies such as "The Da Vinci Code", and it seems that few people have seen it.It has been decided that the site will be renewed, and it has been implemented from today. I think the museum site itself is already the entrance to the museum, so hope that the new design will also attract a lot of people. </p>

		<p>The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic.</p></div>
